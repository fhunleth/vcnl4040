# Scratch notes

## Options to implement

- interrupts: Is the GPIO interrupt hooked up at all? Probably :ambient, :proximity and if possible :both

## Control to offer

There are things we can probably change while the thing is active and for some uses this would be necessary.

- Change interrupt thresholds (proximity and ambient), depending on what ambient situation is
-
